Examples: ./packETHcli -e

All examples assume that we send on interface eth0 and that the packet is stored in file p1.pcap

  mode 1 - send one packet and exit:
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -f p1.pcap                                               - send packet p1.pcap once on interface eth0
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -f p10.pcap -c 5                                         - send 5th packet from file p10.pcap

  mode 2 - send packets at constant rate:
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -m 2 -d 0 -n 0 -f p1.pcap                                - send at max speed, infinite times, display counters every seconf
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -m 2 -d -1 -n 0 -f p1.pcap                               - send at max speed, infinite times, no counters
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -m 2 -d 1000 -n 300 -f p1.pcap                           - send 300 packets with 1000 us (1ms) between them
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -m 2 -b 1500 -t 30 -f p1.pcap                            - send packets with rate 1500 kbit/s for 30s
   ./packETHcli -i eth0 -m 2 -B 100 -n 10000 -f p1.pcap -c 7                     - send 7th packet 10000 times, with rate 100 Mbit/s

  mode 3 - send packets with different rates (speed ramp):
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m   -n 0 -z "100 1500 100" -p 10 -f p1.pcap             - start sendind at 100kbit/s for 10s, then increase rate by 100kbit/s each 10s up to 1500 kbit/s
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m 3 -t 3600 -Z "500 100 1" -p 5 -f p1.pcap              - send with 500Mbit/s for 5s, then decrease rate by 1Mbit/s each 5s. Stop after 3600s if not finished

  mode 4 - send packets with variable size (size ramp):
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m 4 -d 0 -n 0 -s "100 1500 100" -p 10 -f p1.pcap        - send at max speed, start with packet size of 100 bytes for 10s then increase by 100 bytes up to 1500 bytes
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m 4 -d 2000 -n 0 -s "100 1500 100" -p 5 -f p1.pcap      - send with constant rate 500pps (bandwidth changes), increase length by 100 bytes every 5s from 100 to 1500
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m 4 -B 10 -t 300 -s "1000 1500 100" -p 10 -f p1.pcap    - send with constant bandwidth 10Mbit/s (pps changes), increase the length by 100 bytes every 10s from 1000 to 1500

  mode 5 - send packets for IDS testing:
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m 5 -f sample_snort_rules.txt -B 10 -t 60 -S1000 -a 2    - send 50% IDS traffic (-a 2) at 10Mbit/s for 60 seconds, packet size 1000 bytes
   ./packETHcli -i eth1 -m 5 -f sample_snort_rules.txt -d 1000 -t 60 -s "100 1000 100" -a 4 -p 10  - send 100% IDS traffic, 1000pps for 60 seconds, increase packet size from 100 to 1000 bytes
