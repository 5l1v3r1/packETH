###CLI

cd cli

##USAGE:

###GUI version:
The usage of the program should be pretty straightforward. As you will see, there are 4 main windows (first four buttons from the left side). I call them:
- Builder - the page where you build the packet and send it once
- Gen-b - generator for sending packet currently build inside Builder with many options how to send it
- Gen-s - generator that allows you to select up to 10 previosly built packets and send them in different manner
- Pcap window - open a tcpdump/wireshark capture file and load the selected packet into builder

To send the packets you need the SuperUser rights.

###CLI version:
Inside cli subdirectory you can find also the command line version of packETH called packETHcli. Just type "make" inside the subdir. 

Type ./packETHcli -h  for more options.
